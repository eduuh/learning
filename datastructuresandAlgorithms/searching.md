### Objective

1. Describe what a searching algorithm is
2. Implement linear search on arrays.
3. Implement Binary search on sorted arrays.
4. Implement a naive string searching algorithm.
5. Implement the KMP string searching algorithm.


### Linear Search

Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every
element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

#### Javascript has Linear Search

There are many different search methods on arrays in javascript.

  1. indexOf
  2. includes
  3. find
  4. findIndex

But how do these function work?

#### Linear Search Big O

O(1) Best case > finding the item we are looking of right away
O(n) Average =>  O(n)
O(n) worst case > O(n)
