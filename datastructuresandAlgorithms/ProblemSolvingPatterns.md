### Some patterns

1. Frequency counter.
2. Multiple Pointers.
3. Sliding windows.
4. Divide and conquer.
5. Dynamic Programming.
6. Greedy Algorithms.
7. Backtracking.

## Frequency counters.

This patterns uses objects or sets to collect values/Frequencies of values. This
can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with
arrays/strings.


### Multiple Pointers

Creating **pointers** or values that correspond to an index or a position and
move toward the beginning end or middle based on a certain condition.

Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

### Sliding Window

This pattern involves creating a windows which can either be an array or number
from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, then window
either increases or closes(and a new windows is created)

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string.
