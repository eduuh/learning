Repository which i use to practise vim craft. Considering that I use **Colemak Keyboard Layout**, I made the most minimum remaps from default keybindings. This follows **Bunnyfly** remaps. I will customize my nvim setup to suit my personality.

### Colemaks Remaps

The idea is to use HNEI as arrows – keeping the traditional Vim homerow style – and changing as
little else as possible. This means JKL are free to use and NEI need new keys.

- k/K is the new n/N.
- s/S is the new i/I ["inSert"].
- j/J is the new e/E ["Jump" to EOW].
- l/L skip to the beginning and end of lines. Much more intuitive than ^/\$.
- Ctrl-l joins lines, making l/L the veritable "Line" key.
- r replaces i as the "inneR" modifier [e.g. "diw" becomes "drw"].

I am getting better with more practise. Everyday.

Since this Is a **vim daily standup**. I figured I could also use the same repository to store practise typing from.
