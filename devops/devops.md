## Devops

DevOps is a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort within an orgamization to
**automate continuous delivery** of new software versions while quaranteeing
their **correctnetss and reliablility**

### Evolution to Devop

### Waterfall

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Deployments

#### What the industry learn from waterfall model

1. Importance of communication

Business
Development
Deployments

2. Automation. It essential to always include automation.
3. Getting feedback.

The eariel we find an error the easier it is to fix it.

### Agile

1. Agile focused on enhaced communication of the team
2. Agile focused on finding defects and feedback as early as possible.

Agile work to build small project feature using small sprint in a team.
A small feature passed the various project stages called iteration.

1. Vision
2. Iteration 1
3. Iteration 2
4. Iteration 3
5. Product

Each iteration is called a sprint. Each sprint have to pass throug the stages of
developments.

1. plan
2. code
3. build
4. test
5. release
6. Deploy
7. Review
8. Plan

How did enhance communication.

Agile brought the **business** and **developments**

1. **Product owner**
2. **Automation areas**

3. Code commits
4. Unit Tests
5. Code quality
6. Package
7. Integration Tests.

This is what is called **Contiouous Intergration**
The most important factors. The project is demoed to all bussiness stackholders.
**Agile restrospectives**

Contiouous intergration also enhances communication and get immediate feedback.

#### New Challages of Agile

We started building microservices and Monolithic software development approach.

1. Microservices 1.
2. Microservices 2.
3. Microservices 3.
4. Microservices 4.
5. Microservices 9

The new challages brought about a new buzzword => **devops**

### Devops

DevOps brings Team Together.

1. **Business**
2. **Development**
3. **Operations**

The development and operations were brought togethers as close as posible.

##### Automations points

the operation team is responsible for the following.

1. Create Template.
2. Units Tests
3. Intergration tests
4. Package
5. Deploy
6. Automated Tests

A deveops team is responsible for automating the above

The terms used in deveops includes.

1. Continous deployments
2. Contimous delivery.
3. IAC (infrastructure as code)

The continous delivery of software in devops

1. Code commit.
2. Unit Tests
3. Intergration Tests
4. Packages
5. Deploy
6. Automated Tests
7. Testing Approval
8. Deploy Next

The next Automationg point of deveops is IAAC Infrastructer as code. You
provision you infractucture in a similar way we do software developments.

1. Create Template
2. Provision Server.
3. Install software.
4. Configuring software
5. Deploy app.

If a breaking change is introduce , you would get immediate feedback from the
automated code. IAAC .

Agile % DevOps are two faces that help us build amazing software.

### Containerazation

We are in the world of Microservices. This microservices may be writteng in
different languages. Different application , scripts, and enviromints are
differents. Maintaining all the automation scripts of the the environments would
be a pain. This is where docker comes in. Docker provides and isolated
production environment for all the different enviroments

1. Project code
2. Docker Image
3. Docker repository.

When you use containers . Infrastructure as code becomes really easy

1. provision cluster
2. Deploy containers.

Containerazation is what make deveops really Easy.

#### Docker

Install docker. [docker site](https://www.docker.com/). Installation of docker
is very simple.

##### Traditional software development.

The ops team could be given a document describing the environment they need to
create.

Here are some of the details

1. Applications
2. Software
3. Os
4. Hardware

With docker you dont need to worry about the above details. All the developer
needs is to create a dockerImage that would learn the same way on all operating
system using the same instructions.
